[TextBlock(text='<edited_text>\nwhich imply that the conditional quantile regression model can be written as: \n\n$$q_\\tau(y_{it}|x_it,\\alpha_i) = \\beta_0(\\tau) + x_{it}\\beta(\\tau) + \\alpha_i\n$${#eq-canay-qreg}\n\nThis assumption has important implications for the identification of the quantile regression coefficients. First, by assuming that $\\alpha_i$ is a pure location shift, it reduces the number of parameters that need to be estimated in the model, because $\\alpha_i$ can now be estimated globally, while the quantile regression coefficients can be estimated locally. Second, based on the previous insights of the location scale model, it suggests that we can estimate the quantile regression model using a two-step approach. First, estimate all location effects using OLS, and then estimate the scale effects using the predicted residuals, but excluding variables we assume have a pure location shift effect. More formally, the estimator proposed by @canay2011 can be described as follows: \n\n1. Estimate the location effect of $x_{it}$ and the unobserved heterogeneity $\\alpha_i$ on $y_{it}$ using OLS:  \n\n$$y_{it}=\\beta_0 +  x_{it}\' \\beta_1   +\\alpha_i + \\varepsilon_{it}\n$$\n\n2. Use the predicted fixed effects $\\hat\\alpha_i$[^8] to transform the dependent variable as $\\tilde y_{it}=y_{it}-\\hat\\alpha_i$, and estimate the quantile regression model: \n\n[^8]: Empirically, this can be done using the `reghdfe` command, as part of the `abs()` suboptions.\n\n$$q_{\\tau}(\\tilde y_{it}|x_{it}) = \\beta_0(\\tau)+x_{it}\'\\beta_1(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis simple approach allows for the identification of the quantile coefficients, by imposing the assumption that the unobserved characteristics only have a location shift effect on the outcome. In addition, like the CRE model, it can be extended to multiple fixed effects, as long as one is willing to assume that the unobserved effects are pure location shifts. For example, consider a case with two fixed effects dimensions (individual and time), under the assumption that the unobserved effects are pure location shifts, the data generating process can be written as: \n\n$$y_{it} = \\beta_0(U_{it}) + x_{it}\'\\beta(U_{it}) + \\alpha_i + \\alpha_t\n$${#eq-canay-dgp-2way}\n\nAs before, if we assume that $\\alpha_i$ and $\\alpha_t$ are constant across quantiles, we could use the same two-step approach to estimate the quantile regression coefficients. First, estimate the location effects using OLS, and then estimate the quantile regression model using the predicted fixed effects. \n\n$$q_{\\tau}(y_{it}-\\hat \\alpha_i - \\hat \\alpha_t|x_{it})=q_{\\tau}(\\tilde y_{it}|x_{it}) = x_{it}\\beta(\\tau)\n$${#eq-canay-mway}\n\nWhich again can be easily estimated using standard quantile regression methods, and extended to any number of fixed effects. \n\n## Modified Canay(2011) Estimator {#sec-mcanay}\n\nPerhaps one of the main limitations of @canay2011 is that it assumes that the unobserved effect is a pure location shift. In fact, this is one of the criticisms raised by @mss2019 to the estimator. While this makes sense intuitively, because an individual will only be assigned to a single rank at a given point in time, it is not consistent with the idea that the unobserved effect is in fact a proxy for an unobserved characteristic of the individual, and that characteristic could have a different impact on the dependent variable across quantiles. In this case, if this assumption is violated, it may lead to inconsistent estimates of the quantile coefficients. To address this limitation, we propose a small modification to the Canay estimator. \n\nWe start by assuming that the unobserved effect represents some characteristics of the individual that are constant across quantiles, and that can be compared across individuals. Under this consideration, the data generating process can be written as: \n\n$$y_{it} =\\beta_0 +   x_{it}\'\\beta + \\beta_\\alpha \\alpha_i+\n\\gamma_0(U_{it}) +  x_{it}\'\\gamma(U_{it}) + \\gamma_\\alpha(U_{it}) \\alpha_i\n$${#eq-mcanay-dgp}\n\nWhere $\\alpha_i$ is the unobserved effect, $\\beta_\\alpha$ is the location coefficient of the unobserved heterogeneity, and $\\gamma(U_{it})$ is a smooth function that varies across quantiles. For the identification of $\\alpha_i$, we start with the same approach as @canay2011, imposing the assumption that $\\beta_\\alpha=1$. In other words, the first step from @canay2011 is the same as the first step presented before. \n\nThe second step, however, suggests that rather than transforming the dependent variable using the predicted fixed effects, we should estimate the quantile regression model using the predicted unobserved effects as an additional explanatory variable. This can be done by estimating the following model: \n\n$$q_{\\tau}(y_{it}|x_{it},\\hat \\alpha_i) =  x_{it}\\beta(\\tau)+\\beta(\\tau) \\hat\\alpha_i\n$$\n\nAs before, this model can be extended to multiple fixed effects, by simply estimating the unobserved effects using OLS, and then estimating the quantile regression model using the predicted unobserved effects. The main advantage over @canay2011 is that this estimator allows for the unobserved effect to have a different impact on the dependent variable across quantiles, which may be more realistic in many applications. However, it assumes the OLS estimator does allow for the consistent estimation of an unobserved effect that is comparable across individuals, which may not always be the case. \n\nIn terms of standard errors, @canay2011 provides some guidance for the derivation of analytical standard errors for their estimator. Recently, however, @besstremyannaya2019 has shown that the standard errors derivations are incorrect. Instead, based on their recommendations, we suggest that the bootstrap method should be used for the estimation of the standard errors for both the Canay and Modified Canay estimators. \n\n## Method of Moments Quantile Regression @mss2019 {#sec-mmqr}\n\nThe last methodology we consider is the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQREG) estimator proposed by @mss2019, and extended by @riosavila2024. The methodology was proposed as a feasible approach to incorporate fixed effects in a quantile regression model, allowing for unobserved effects to have a different impact on the dependent variable across quantiles. This is done by separating the identification of quantile coefficients into a location, scale and quantile effect, using a method of moments approach. \n\nTo understand this approach, let\'s consider the data generating process from @eq-loc-scale. As mentioned earlier, this approach suggests that a quantile regression model can be identified using a location-scale model, where the location effect shows the average effect of the covariates on the dependent variable, and the scale effect shows the heterogeneous effect of the covariates, as deviation from the location effect. @mss2019 extends this idea, by suggesting that the scale component can be further decomposed into a pure scale effect, and a mediating factor. Specifically, the author considers the case where the data generating process can be written as: \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nY_{i} &= \\beta_0 + x_{i}\' \\beta + (\\delta_0 + X_{i}\' \\delta)*\\mu_i) \\text{ or} \\\\\nY_{i} &= \\beta_0 + x_{i}\' \\beta + (\\delta_0 + X_{i}\' \\delta)*F^{-1}(U_i)) \\text{ or} \n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-dgp_mmqreg}\n\nThis specification assumes that $\\mu_i$ is an identically and independently distributed random variable with any arbitrary distribution. $\\delta_0 + X_{i}\' \\delta$ denotes the multiplicative scale component (heteroskedasticity generating component), and $\\beta_0 + x_{i}\' \\beta$ denotes the location coefficients. The second line in @eq-dgp_mmqreg, represents the same model, but using the inverse of the distribution function of $U_i$ as the mediating factor. As before, $U_i$ is a random variable that follows a uniform distribution, and captures the rank of the individual among all individuals with the same characteristics. \n\nWhat is interesting about this specification is that it simplifies the identification of the quantile coefficients further, by imposing a strict parametric relationship across the scale coefficients. Specifically, that they are directly related to the values of $\\mu_i$ or $F^{-1}(U_i)$. Thus, the location and scale coefficients can be identified globally, requiring only the local identification of the distribution of $\\mu_i$. \n\nFor this simple case, the MMQREG estimator can be described as follows:[^9] \n\n[^9]: Further details on the implementation of the methodology can be found in @mss2019, with additional extensions in @riosavila2024.\n\n1. Estimate the location effect of $x_{i}$ on $y_{i}$ using OLS: \n\n$$y_{i} = \\beta_0 + x_{i}\' \\beta + R_i$$\n\n2. Use the predicted residuals $\\hat R_i$ to estimate the scale effect using OLS, where the dependent variable is defined as $|\\hat R_i|$: \n\n$$|\\hat R_i| = \\delta_0 + x_{i}\' \\delta$$\n\n3. Obtain a standardized residual by dividing the residuals of (1) by the predicted scale effect from (2), and estimate the $\\tau th$ unconditional quantile of this distribution: \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat \\mu_i &= \\frac{\\hat R_i}{\\delta_0 + x_{i}\' \\delta} \\\\\nq_{\\tau}(\\hat \\mu_i) &= q_0(\\tau)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n4. Finally, the quantile regression coefficients can be estimated by the following equation: \n\n$$\\beta_{\\tau} = \\beta + q_0(\\tau) \\delta\n$$\n\nIt can be seen that because Steps 1 and 2 are estimated globally using OLS, they can easily be extended to multiple fixed effects, without major difficulties. One can simply assume, for example, that the fixed effects are estimated using a dummy variable approach, and all the steps described above follow. [^10] The derivation of standard errors follows from the use of the method of moments approach, and the identification of the empirical influence functions. \n\n[^10]: In @riosavila2024, additional steps are presented because of the use of partial-out covariates. However, the same results can be obtained using the simpler approach described here.\n\nDespite the flexibility of this approach, it is important to note that the MMQR estimator is based on the assumption that all quantile coefficients are constructed as a simple combination of the location and scale coefficients. They only differ in the value of the mediating factor, the unconditional quantile of the standardized residual. This may be a strong assumption, and may not be applicable in all cases.\n</edited_text>\n\n<change_explanations>\n1.
