[TextBlock(text='<edited_text>\nConsider the following model: \n\n$$y_{it} = \\beta_0 + x_{it}\\beta  + \\alpha_i + u_{it}\n$${#eq-cre-1}\n\nIt is well known that if $\\alpha_i$ is correlated with $x_{it}$, the Random Effects (RE) estimator will be inconsistent, due to the omitted variable bias. The solution proposed by @mundlak1978 and @chamberlain1982 was to explicitly account for that correlation in the model, by assuming the unobserved effect $\\alpha_i$ is a linear projection of the observed time-varying variables plus an uncorrelated disturbance. Specifically: \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nMundlak:  & & \\alpha_i &= \\gamma_0 + \\bar x_{i}\\gamma + v_i&  \\\\\nChamberlain: & & \\alpha_i &= \\gamma_0 + x_{i1}\\gamma_1 + x_{i2}\\gamma_2 + \\dots + x_{iT}\\gamma_T + v_i \n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-cre-2}\n\nThe main difference between both approaches was that @chamberlain1982 proposes a more flexible specification allowing all realizations of the time-varying variables to explain the unobserved effect. In contrast, Mundlak\'s approach only considers the average of the time-varying variables, which is a more restrictive specification. Using either model specification, if we substitute @eq-cre-2 into @eq-cre-1, the final model can be written as: \n\n$$y_{it} = \\beta_0 + x_{it}\\beta  + \\gamma_0 + f(x_{it})\\Gamma + v_i + u_{it}\n$${#eq-cre-final}\n\nwhere $f(x_{it})$ can be the full set of time-varying variables or just the average of them. Notice that in this specification, $\\beta_0$ and $\\gamma_0$ cannot be independently identified, and that the new model now has a compound error $v_i + u_{it}=\\mu_it$, which is uncorrelated with $x_{it}$. To account for the within-individual correlation driven by $v_i$, the CRE model should be estimated using either random effects, or clustering standard errors at the individual level (see @wooldridge2010 for a discussion). Interestingly, either method provides the same results if the panel data is balanced, and all covariates are strictly exogenous. However, this identity breaks down in other cases (see @abrevaya2013). \n\nThe strategy proposed by @abrevaya2008 was to extend the CRE model (@chamberlain1982 style) for the estimation of quantile regression models. This, however, has some limitations. First, when the number of periods is large, the number of additional regressors grows quickly, which can lead to other problems during estimation. Second, while the application of @chamberlain1982 projection approach for unbalanced data is possible (see @abrevaya2013), it is not straightforward to implement in practice, especially for the framework of quantile regressions. Instead, we follow @wooldridge2010 and @wooldridge2019, and use the Mundlak representation of the CRE model for the estimation of quantile regression models. @wooldridge2019 has shown that this can be easily applied for cases with unbalanced panels, and the estimation of non-linear models. \n\nSpecifically, @wooldridge2010 suggests that we could use a local projection of the quantile-specific unobserved effect. If we concentrate on $\\alpha(U_{it})$, where $U_{it}$ is a random variable that follows a uniform distribution, we could write the unobserved effect as: \n\n$$\\alpha_i(U_{it})=\\gamma_0(U_{it})+\\bar x_i\'\\gamma(U_{it}) + v^{U_{it}}_i\n$${#eq-cre_alpha}\n\nThen, we can use @eq-cre_alpha to write the new Data Generating Process (DGP): \n\n$$y_{it} = \\beta_0(U_{it}) + x_{it}\\beta(U_{it}) + \\gamma_0(U_{it}) + \\bar x_i\'\\gamma(U_{it}) + v^{U_{it}}_i \n$${#eq-cre-dgp}\n\nTwo important points to note here. First, as before, $\\beta_0(\\cdot)$ and $\\gamma_0(\\cdot)$ cannot be independently identified, which makes the interpretation of the constant term difficult. Second, $v^{U_{it}}_i$ is not a smooth function of $U_{it}$, but rather an unrelated disturbance that is left after modeling the unobserved effect, and remains unobserved. If we assume that $v^{U_{it}}_i$ is small enough compared to the overall variation driven by $U_{it}$, we could identify the quantile regression coefficients as follows:  \n\n$$q_\\tau(y_{it}|x_{it},\\bar x_i)=b_0(\\tau) + x_{it}\\beta(\\tau)+\\bar x_i\'\\gamma(\\tau)\n$${#eq-cre-1way}\n\nWhich can be estimated using any standard quantile regression method. However, if $v^{U_{it}}_i$ is large, standard estimators will leverage the distribution of the compound error $v^{U_{it}}_i$ and $U_{it}$, which may lead to inconsistent estimates of the quantile coefficients. [^5] \n\n[^5]: This is the main critique raised by @canay2011 to the estimator proposed by @abrevaya2008. In fact, the more dominant $v^{U_{it}}_i$ becomes, the more the estimates will resemble the OLS estimates.\n\nNevertheless, assuming that the residual $v^{U_{it}}_i$ is small, the CRE-quantile regression approach has a few other benefits that may be of interest. First, as discussed in @wooldridge2019, it can be easily used in the presence of unbalanced panels. Second, it may also provide an approach to control for multiple fixed effects. [^6] For example, let us expand on @eq-dgp-panel, and consider the case of a two-way fixed effects model: \n\n[^6]: @baltagi2023 and @wooldridge2021 discuss this for the two-way Mundlak estimator\n\n$$y_{it} = \\beta_0(U_{it}) + x_{it}\'\\beta(U_{it}) + \\alpha_i(U_{it}) + \\alpha_t(U_{it})\n$$\n\nTo apply the two-way CRE model, we could use the following representation of the unobserved effects: \n\n$$\\alpha_i(U_{it}) + \\alpha_t(U_{it}) = \\gamma_0(U_{it}) + \\lambda_i^x \\gamma_i(U_{it}) + \\lambda_t^x \\gamma_t(U_{it}) + v^{U_{it}}_{it}\n$${#eq-cre-unobs}\n\nwhere $\\lambda_i^x$ and $\\lambda_t^x$ are obtained by estimating the following model for each explanatory variable $x_{it}$: \n\n$$x_{it} -\\bar x = \\lambda_i^x + \\lambda_t^x + \\epsilon_{it}\n$${#eq-cre-2way}\n\nWe use the centered transformation of the explanatory variable, that is $x_{it}-\\bar x$, so that all $\\lambda\'s$ have an expected value of zero. In contrast with @baltagi2023, we suggest that rather than modeling each individual component separately, it is easier to think of the problem of modeling the combination of the two (or many) unobserved components as a function of $\\lambda_i^x$ and $\\lambda_t^x$, which are the equivalent to $\\bar x_i$ in the Mundlak one-way fixed effect model. Additionally, different from @wooldridge2021 and @baltagi2023, we emphasize that the estimation of $\\lambda_i^x$ and $\\lambda_t^x$ should be done simultaneously (@eq-cre-2way), rather than estimating the conditional means separately. This is more general and applicable to any number of fixed effects. This can be done using an iterative process similar to @rios2015 or @correia_feasible_nodate.[^7] \n\n[^7]: If the panel is perfectly balanced, estimating $\\lambda_i^x$ and $\\lambda_t^x$ separately will provide the same results as estimating them simultaneously. Internally, we use @correia_feasible_nodate `reghdfe` to obtain the predicted fixed effects\n\nWith these considerations, the conditional quantile regression can be written as: \n\n$$q_\\tau(y_{it}|x_{it},\\lambda_i^x,\\lambda_t^x)=x\'_{it}\\beta(\\tau)+{\\lambda^x_i}\'\\gamma_i(\\tau)\n+{\\lambda^x_t}\'\\gamma_t(\\tau)  \n$$\n\nWhich could be extended to any number of fixed effects. As before, this approach is valid if the residual $v^{U_{it}}_{it}$ from the time and individual fixed effects (or all fixed effects considered) are small enough compared to the variation driven by the latent rank variable $U_{it}$. \n\nIn terms of the standard errors, for the linear CRE model, it is suggested to use the random effects estimator, or clustering standard errors at the individual level. For the quantile regression model, clustering standard errors at the individual level is also suggested by @wooldridge2010, and some routines already implement this feature. When multiple fixed effects are considered, it is suggested to use the bootstrap methods for the estimation of the standard errors. \n\n## Canay (2011) Estimator {#sec-canay}\n\nThe second approach under consideration is the estimator proposed by @canay2011. As mentioned before, this paper argues that the estimator proposed by @abrevaya2008, and thus the implementation described above, may not provide consistent estimates of the quantile regression coefficients, as long as there is a disturbance $v^{U_{it}}_i$ left after modeling @eq-cre_alpha. Instead, under the assumption that the unobserved effect is a pure location shift, they propose an alternative estimator that can be used to consistently estimate the quantile regression coefficients. \n\nBefore presenting the estimator, it is convenient to review a second approach that has been used to understand quantile regression models: The location-scale model. Under this specification, consider the following data generating process: \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\ny_i &= \\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_i + \\gamma_0(U_i) + \\gamma_1(U_i) x_{i} \\ \\text{or}\\\\\ny_i &= \\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_i + \\mu_i\n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-loc-scale}\n\nIn this specification, we assume that $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are the location parameters that capture how the whole distribution of $y_i$ is affected by $x_i$. In contrast, $\\gamma_0(U_i)$ and $\\gamma_1(U_i)$ are the scale parameters that capture the heterogeneous effect of $x_i$ on $y_i$ that deviates from the location effect. When using a simple linear regression model, estimated via OLS, we could assume that the compound component $\\gamma_0(U_i) + \\gamma_1(U_i) x_{i}$ is fully captured by the error term $\\mu_i$. \n\nThis provides three insights. First, that OLS could be used to identify the location effect of $x_i$ on $y_i$, which we know as the average or conditional mean effect. Second, if $\\gamma_1(U_i)$ is different from zero, the model is heteroskedastic, and the quantile regression could be used to identify this type of unobserved heterogeneity. Lastly, if a covariate has no scale effect, all quantile coefficients will be the same as the OLS coefficient, except for the constant. \n\nAlthough of little use, this location-scale model can be easily estimated using a two-step approach. First, estimate the location effect of $x_i$ on $y_i$ using OLS: \n\n$$y_i = \\beta_0+x_i\'\\beta + \\mu_i\n$${#eq-ls-1}\n\nThen, using the predicted residuals $\\hat \\mu_i$, estimate the quantile regression model: \n\n$$q_\\tau(\\hat \\mu_i|x_i)=\\gamma_0(\\tau)+ x_i\'\\gamma(\\tau)\n$${#eq-ls-2}\n\nIt is a simple exercise to show that adding $\\beta+\\gamma(\\tau)$ provides the same point estimates as estimating the full quantile regression model. However, it does provide a simple connection between OLS and quantile regression models. \n\nNow, let\'s reconsider the data generating process in @eq-dgp-panel. @canay2011 imposes the assumption that $\\alpha_i$ is a pure location shift that should be constant across quantiles. More explicitly, the data generating process in a panel data setting can be written as follows: \n\n$$y_{it} = \\beta_0(U_{it}) + x_{it}\\beta(U_{it}) + \\alpha_i\n$${#eq-canay-dgp}\n</edited_text>\n\n<change_explanations>\n1.
